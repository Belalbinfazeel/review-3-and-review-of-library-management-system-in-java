Project Overview:
The Library Management System is a desktop application designed to help librarians and administrators manage a library's resources efficiently. Built using Java and Swing, this system provides a user-friendly graphical interface for performing various administrative tasks such as adding, updating, and removing books, managing library staff, issuing and returning books, and tracking issued books. It integrates with a MySQL database to store and manage data securely.

Key Features:
Admin Login:

Admin users can log in to the system with predefined credentials (username: admin, password: admin123).
The login screen ensures that only authorized users can access the library's administrative features.
Admin Dashboard:

After a successful login, the admin is presented with a dashboard that includes options to manage books, librarians, and other system features.
Book Management:

Add, update, and delete books from the system.
Maintain a catalog of available books, their authors, publication years, and other details.
Issue and Return Books:

The system allows for issuing books to library users and keeping track of returned books.
The admin can view a list of all issued books and their due dates.
Librarian Management:

Admin can add and remove librarian accounts to help manage the system.
Assign specific roles and responsibilities to different librarians.
Database Integration:

The system uses MySQL as the backend database to store information such as book details, issue records, and librarian data.
It ensures secure storage and retrieval of data, supporting all operations of the system.
User Interface:

The graphical interface is developed using Java Swing, providing a modern and interactive experience.
It includes forms for login, managing books, adding librarians, and viewing issued books.
Error Handling:

The system displays appropriate error messages if an action is unsuccessful, such as incorrect login credentials or issues during book issue/return processes.
Technologies Used:
Java (Swing): Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI) for the library management system.
MySQL: A relational database management system used to store and manage all data.
JDBC: Java Database Connectivity used to connect Java with MySQL for database operations.
Java 1.8+: The project is built on Java 8 or later.
Benefits of the System:
Efficiency: Automates tasks such as tracking book issues and returns, reducing manual work.
Security: Admin login ensures that only authorized users can manage sensitive data.
Data Management: Centralized management of books, librarian accounts, and issued books in a secure database.
User-friendly: Easy-to-navigate interface, making it convenient for administrators and librarians to use
